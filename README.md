# Multiplicity

A Python package for analyzing predictive multiplicity in machine learning models. This package implements a meta-model framework that combines classification and regression models to study and evaluate predictive multiplicity.

## Features

1. **Meta-model Framework**
   - Combines classification and regression models
   - Compatible with scikit-learn estimators
   - Flexible architecture for different model combinations

2. **Multiplicity Analysis**
   - Multiplicity scoring
   - Decision boundary analysis
   - Stability evaluation
   - Comprehensive visualization tools

3. **Visualization Tools**
   - Decision boundary plots
   - Regression curves
   - Multiplicity heatmaps
   - Stability analysis plots
